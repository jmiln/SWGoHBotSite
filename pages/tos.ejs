            <h3>Introduction & Acceptance</h3>
            <p>
                By inviting or using SWGoHBot ("the Bot"), you automatically agree to these Terms of Service. You must also comply with <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord's Terms of Service</a> and any rules of the Discord servers where you use the Bot. If you don't agree to these terms, please don't use the Bot. See our <a href="https://swgohbot.com/privacyPolicy">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we handle your data.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Rights & Our Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                You can use the Bot for free as long as you follow Discord's Terms of Service and the rules of any server you're in. We reserve the right to block access, deny service, or report violations to Discord if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Service Limitations:</strong> The Bot's availability is not guaranteed—we may experience downtime, maintenance, or service interruptions. Game data is obtained through a third-party API and sourced from the game itself. We're not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or availability of this game data. Premium features (like arena alerts) require an active Patreon subscription.
            </p>

            <h3>Important Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>No Warranty:</strong> The Bot is provided "as is" without any warranties or guarantees. We don't guarantee that it will be error-free, always available, or meet your specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> We're not responsible for any damages, losses, or issues that result from using or being unable to use the Bot. This includes lost game data, missed events, or any other consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We're not responsible for how users interact with the Bot or any content generated through it. Users are responsible for ensuring their use of the Bot complies with Discord's Terms of Service and server rules.
            </p>

            <h3>Contact & Changes</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to These Terms:</strong> We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top shows when the terms were last revised. Continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the updated terms.
