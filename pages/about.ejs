                Firstly, <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone in the SWGoH community who has supported the bot, be it through contributing to the code, or by simply just using it. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This bot started off  with me trying to make the mods on <a href="apps.crouchingrancor.com/">crouchingrancor.com</a> more accesible to my guild and I, since we were always on Discord anyways. It has since grown way past any expectations I'd had when I started working on it, and grown to be more of an overall info source on the game, making it so you don't have to check the game or <a href="https://swgoh.gg">swgoh.gg</a> as often.
            </p>
