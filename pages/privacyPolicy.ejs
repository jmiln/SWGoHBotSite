                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 20, 2026</p>
                <hr>

                <p>
                    By using SWGoHBot ("the Bot"), you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how long we keep it, and your rights regarding your data.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Server/Guild IDs:</strong> Discord server identifiers where the Bot is used, for guild-specific features and settings</li>

                <p>
                    We fetch your public game data from EA's servers using the ally codes you provide. Your Discord information is not shared with EA or any other third parties.

                <h3>Data Security</h3>
                <p>
                    Your data is stored in a secured database to prevent unauthorized access. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the event of an unauthorized data breach, we will notify affected users through the Discord client application.
                </p>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The Bot interacts with the following third-party services:</p>

                <h4>EA Game API</h4>
                <p>
                    We fetch your public Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes game data directly from EA's servers using the ally codes you provide. Your Discord user ID and other Discord-related information is <strong>not shared</strong> with EA. Only your ally code is used to retrieve publicly available game data.
                </p>

                <h4>Patreon API</h4>
                <p>
                    For premium subscribers, we fetch subscription information from the Patreon API to verify your subscription status. This is limited to your Patreon ID and Discord ID. Patreon handles all payment processing—we do not receive or store your credit card or payment information.
                </p>

                <h4>Discord OAuth2</h4>
                <p>
                    The SWGoHBot website offers optional login via Discord's OAuth2 service. When you log in, your browser is redirected to Discord's authorization page, and Discord returns your basic profile information to us: your Discord user ID, username, and avatar. We use this solely to identify you on the website and provide access to configuration features. Your Discord credentials (password) are never shared with or visible to us.
                </p>

                <h4>This Website</h4>
                <p>
                    When you log in to the SWGoHBot website, we set a session cookie to keep you signed in. This cookie is stored in your browser and links to a session record in our database containing your Discord user ID, username, and avatar. Sessions expire after 7 days or immediately on logout. If you do not log in, no cookies are set and no data is collected by the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website does not use tracking pixels or third-party analytics services.
                </p>
