            <hr>
            <p>
            The use of this application ("Bot") in a server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). The Data collected includes, but is not limited to Discord user ID values. Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy.
            <br>
            <h3>Acccess to Data:</h3>
            Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party.
            <br>
            <h3>Storage of Data:</h3>
            Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.
            <br>
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
