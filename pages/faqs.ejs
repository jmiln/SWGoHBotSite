                    <h3>How do I use the bot's commands?</h3>
                    <p>
                        SWGoHBot uses Discord's slash commands. Simply type <code>/</code> in any channel where the bot has access, and Discord will show you available commands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To see all available commands and their descriptions, use the <code>/help</code> command. You can also view the complete command list on our <a href="/commands">commands page</a>.

                    <h3>How do I set up the bot for my guild?</h3>
                    <p>
                        To get started with guild features, you'll need to register your ally code with the bot. This allows the bot to pull your character and guild information from the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use the <code>/register</code> command to link your account. Once registered, you can use commands like <code>/profile</code>, <code>/guildsearch</code>, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For server-specific configuration (like setting announcement channels or time zones), server administrators can use the setup commands. Type <code>/help</code> and look for admin or configuration commands.

                    <h3>The bot isn't responding to my commands. What should I do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the bot isn't responding, try these troubleshooting steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check permissions:</strong> Make sure the bot has permission to read messages and send messages in the channel you're using</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify the bot is online:</strong> Look at the member list - the bot should show as online (green status)</li>
                        <li><strong>Try the help command:</strong> Type <code>/help</code> to verify the bot can see your commands</li>
                        <li><strong>Check for Discord outages:</strong> Sometimes Discord has issues with slash commands during outages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>

                    <h3>How do I get help or report a bug?</h3>
                    <p>
                        For help using the bot or to report issues, join our <a href="/server">Discord support server</a>. Our community and support team are active and ready to help you!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're a developer and want to contribute to the bot or report technical bugs in the code, you can visit our <a href="https://github.com/jmiln/swgohbot">GitHub repository</a>. However, for general usage questions and support, Discord is the best place to get help quickly.

                    <h3>Is my data safe? What information does the bot collect?</h3>
                    <p>
                        SWGoHBot takes your privacy seriously. The bot only collects information necessary to provide its services, primarily your ally code and associated Discord user ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All character, guild, and game data is pulled from the public Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes API. The bot does not have access to your EA account credentials or any personal information beyond what you explicitly share through Discord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
